Let's get started


This is a start I hope that will actually have something in my life. I always get excited but as all the great men of history say to much 
excitement is what can destroy a person.


I don't want to be the person who looks back to himself/herself after a few years and think my past self was such a dush. If only he/she
did this and did that. No, I want to be the person who says at least he/she tried. I love the person who was, is and always.

To love one's own self that's what the world really needs. We seek so much affirmation from other people that we tend to forget about 
ourselves and that's the real tragedy.(3/12/2017)
